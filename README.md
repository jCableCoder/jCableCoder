### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<!--
**jCableCoder/jCableCoder** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:


-->
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently finishing up the pre-work curriculum and looking forward to the first day of classes on May 13!
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about GitHub, VS Code and file systems.
- ðŸ‘¯ I'm geeking out that the Cavs beat the Celtics in Boston last night! (I'm guessing this comment won't age well.)
- I'm a Mac guy, and I'm doing my best to adapt to a Windows environment for these classes!
